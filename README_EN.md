# TUIKit uni-app Solution

[简体中文](README.md) | English

## Overview

TUIKit uni-app is a powerful UI component library built on Tencent Cloud's `AtomicXCore` SDK. `AtomicXCore` integrates the core capabilities of Tencent Cloud Real-Time Communication (TRTC), Instant Messaging (IM), Audio/Video Calling (TUICallEngine), and Room Management (TUIRoomEngine), providing a state-driven API design.

TUIKit uni-app provides a set of pre-built user interfaces (UI) on top of the core capabilities provided by `AtomicXCore`, enabling you to quickly integrate video interactive live streaming, voice chat rooms, audio/video calling, and instant messaging features into your uni-app applications without worrying about complex backend logic and state management.

## Usage Guide

Developers should choose the corresponding component directory based on the final **target packaging platform**:

- **iOS/Android App Development**: Use components from `./App` directory
- **WeChat Mini Program Development**: Use components from `./MiniProgram` directory

Through this separation, you can ensure that the components for each platform are **optimally adapted** versions, avoiding compatibility issues caused by cross-platform differences.
